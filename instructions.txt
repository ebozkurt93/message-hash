
Take Home Challenge
Publish a small service on the web that has two endpoints:

1. /messages takes a message (a string) as a POST and returns the SHA256 hash digest of that
message (in hexadecimal format)

2. /messages/<hash> is a GET request that returns the original message. A request to a non-existent
<hash> should return a 404 error.

You need to deploy your service to a publicly accessible url.

Note that in Mac or linux, you can use command line to check SHA256 of a string:
echo -n "foo" | shasum -a 256
